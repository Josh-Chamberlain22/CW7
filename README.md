## Design Patterns
  * The design pattern that I first saw was the abstract factory design pattern. The design pattern shows itself within the relationship between AnimalWorld, AfricaF and Cf. It allows the user to create a herbivore and a carnivore in AnimalWorld. There is also a decorator design pattern, allowing specific instances of each Wildebeesst, Bison, Lion, and Wolf to be decorated with different states.
